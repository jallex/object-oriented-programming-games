README assignment 4

The BasicPyramidModel class:
I changed the remove method that takes in 4 arguments and removes 2 cards so that
it uses the helper “isUncoveredTwoCard” which has more lenient rules for if a card
is half-covered in the Relaxed class.
I made many methods protected instead of private so that I could override
them in the classes extending it.
