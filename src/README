README assignment 4

The BasicPyramidModel class:
I changed the remove method that takes in 4 arguments and removes 2 cards so that
it uses the helper “isUncoveredTwoCard” which has more lenient rules for if a card
is half-covered in the Relaxed class.
I made many methods protected instead of private so that I could override
them in the classes extending it.

The PyramidSolitaireTextualController class:
I changed playGame so that it displays the pyramid before any moves are made, because it
was not doing so previously. Also, I made it so that it is not creating a new view every time
that it renders, and this also avoided code duplication which was one of the things I got points
off for in Assignment 3.
